## About

Isoverse is a suite of platform-independent (Windows, Mac, Linux), open-source data tools for the efficient and reproducible processing of stable isotope data. Although written primarily in R, it can be used in both RMarkdown as well as Jupyter data processing notebooks. Due to the design based on the popular tidyverse style of R programming, all isoverse packages are easily extendable and work great with tidyverse packages such as tidyr, dplyr and ggplot.
